# Multinomial-Choice-Models
Multinomial choice models are used to model decisions where the outcome is a choice among more than two discrete alternatives.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem
Weâ€™re modeling commuter mode choice: Bike, Bus, or Car

Each person chooses one mode, based on:

time: travel time in minutes

cost: cost of using the mode

risk: chance of accident

These are the independent variables (x); the choice is the dependent variable (y)



Step 2: Why Use a Multinomial Logit Model
Standard linear regression doesnâ€™t work for choices like bike/bus/car

MNL allows us to estimate probabilities for each choice

Itâ€™s based on utility theory: people choose the option with the highest perceived utility




Step 3: Data Preparation
You reshape the dataset to long format so each row represents an individual-alternative pair

You create a "chosen" column to indicate which option was actually selected

You generate dummy variables for the alternatives (bus/car), using bike as a reference



Step 4: Model Estimation (MLE)
The model estimates Î² coefficients using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

For each alternative (Bus and Car), you get:

Î²_time, Î²_cost, Î²_risk, and intercept terms

These coefficients show how each factor affects the log-odds of choosing that mode vs. the reference (bike)



Step 5: Interpretation of Results
From the output, you learn:

Coefficient : Meaning
Negative Î²_time	: Longer travel time decreases the chance of choosing that mode
Positive Î²_cost :	Higher cost increases likelihood (counterintuitive â†’ may need deeper analysis)
Significant p-values (< 0.05) : Those variables significantly influence mode choice
Odds ratios :	Show how a 1-unit change affects the relative odds of choosing Bus/Car over Bike



Step 6: Predicting for an Average Commuter
You calculate the average values of time, cost, and risk

You plug these into the model for each mode

You get predicted probabilities of choosing:

Bike: X%

Bus: Y%

Car: Z%

These give real-world insight into how a typical person is likely to behave.



Step 7: Policy Implications / Applications
Transportation planners can use this to:

Predict behavior if costs or risks change (e.g. raise bus fares)

Simulate what happens if biking becomes safer (reduce risk â†’ increase biking)

Marketers or urban planners can apply similar models to product choice, city planning, etc.



ðŸ“Œ Final Takeaways
MNL helps us move beyond binary or numeric outcomes into categorical decision-making

The model quantifies how sensitive choices are to different variables (like cost, time, or risk)

This is critical for prediction, simulation, and policy design
